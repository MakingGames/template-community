# Volunteer Coaches Needed for Baseball

Our baseball program relies on dedicated volunteer coaches to make each season a success. We're currently looking for coaches for all age divisions!

## Why Coach?

- Make a positive impact on young athletes
- Share your love of the game
- Build relationships with families in our community
- Flexible time commitment

## What We Provide

- Coach training clinic (early March)
- All equipment and uniforms
- Practice plans and drills
- Support from experienced coordinators

## No Experience Necessary

You don't need to be a former player to be a great coach! Our training program covers all the basics, and our coordinators are always available to help.

## How to Sign Up

If you're interested in coaching, please contact our Baseball Coordinator or fill out the volunteer form on our contact page.

Coaches who sign up by February 28 will receive a complimentary coach's shirt!
